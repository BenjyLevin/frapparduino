============

Frapparduino ES50 Final Project

This repo contains the code for the server that operated our Frapparduino machine.

The server is set up using `express-generator`, serving `index.html` to `localhost:3000`.

The Arduino is running `StandardFirmata`, and we are controlling it using the `Johnny-Five` library.

A basic guidelines of operation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/college.harvard.edu/document/d/1xz6i_HI47iapmkGX5UJwI2_CMJZZHI8yxQyurxZ1Axw/edit).
